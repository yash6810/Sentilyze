# Project Vision: The Ultimate Goal

This document outlines the long-term vision for the Sentilyze project, as described by the project owner.

The ultimate goal is to transform Sentilyze into a comprehensive, AI-powered investment engine capable of making profitable trading decisions across a wide range of assets, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other online financial instruments.

## Key Features of the Final Version:

*   **Universal Asset Analysis**: The application will not be limited to specific stocks. It will be able to search the entire market, including stocks, crypto (like Bitcoin), and other assets, to identify investment opportunities.

*   **Automated Trading Bot**: The final version will function as an automated trading bot ("algotrading" and "AI trading"). It will not just provide analysis but will also be able to execute trades based on its predictions.

*   **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: The engine will leverage "everything on the internet" to inform its decisions. This implies a very sophisticated data ingestion and analysis pipeline that goes beyond the current news and price data.

*   **High Accuracy**: The core requirement for the final version is to achieve a high level of predictive accuracy, enabling it to generate profits (while acknowledging that losses are also possible).

*   **Collaborative Use**: The application is intended to be used not just for personal growth but also with friends, implying a potential for a collaborative or social trading aspect.

This vision is dynamic and may evolve over time. The current development roadmap, including the creation of a hybrid prediction system, is a foundational step towards achieving this ultimate goal.
